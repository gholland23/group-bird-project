        <h1>WE LIKE BIRDS</h1>
        <p> As a group, we decided to branch out the box for this project. The reason being is that the majority of the world right now
          is sad. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only taken over the world, but it also invaded Kaggle. While scanning the website for topics, it seemed like every 
          freaking dataset was about COVID and its stats. Then, we came upon a dataset about birds...and well no pun intended, but our 
          imaginations took flight. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          QUESTIONS WE WANTED TO ANSWER!
        </h2>
        <li>
          "Where are these birds located?"
        </li>
        <li>
          "Where do they migrate to?"
        </li>
        <li>
          "Is it safe to say birds migrate to the equator?"
        </li>
        <h2>
          HOW DID WE DO IT?
        </h2>
        <li>
          Our original dataset only contained the names of 150 birds and pictures that associated each bird. In order to answer these questions 
          we had to look up and generate coordinates for each bird and create a true database. Out of the 150 birds we chose 30 to look up 
          origin and migration coordinates of. After this data was collected, Nam used Postgres to create that database. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The second step was to use leaflet to map out the bird's location (origin markers). 
        </li>
        <li>
          Then using the destination markers we would use leaflet to create lines demonstrating the migration patterns of our birds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, we plotted markers using the destination locations and plotted a shape around the equator with appropriate measurements
          in hopes of ansewring our question.
